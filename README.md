## Use of tools for Design: Figma
Figma is a design tool that can use for design User Interface. Similar to Sketch, it has a more collaborative way to work with other team members. I use both Sketch and Figma in my daily work, but I want to give Figma a shot for this time, and it also can share the mock-up with a simple link.

## On the Design Process
In order to quickly grab the concepts and resources and produce a well-rounded Press page, I start to conduct my design in such steps:

1. Roughly Browse the TrueLayer website, to get the whole picture of what TrueLayer have done so far and how it has done for its design system.
2. Carefully read the **Brand Guidelines**, and search for the fonts style and copy color hex code to the Figma, prepare the library that could be used for the further design process based on the guidelines.
3. Sketch the wireframe, follow the design flow of the current pages, figure out the arrangement of the articles and what kind of feature that may interest the user to see in the press page. 
4. Analyze the TrueLayer webpage, use the **"console tool"** of the browser to look for the assets of the pages, reuse the current icons, background, and gradients.
5. Start to make the mock-up.

## On the Coding Process

* Use **Webpack4** to bundle HTML,CSS, and Javascript.
* Use **Yarn** to manage third-party library.
* Include **Bootstrap 4** and **Fontawesome** to the project.
* Use console tool of Chrome, to include all the current CSS and JS file to the project.
* Based on the current TrueLayer Homepage HTML code, roughly build the press page HTML sturcture.
* Writing CSS by **SASS** preprocessor.
